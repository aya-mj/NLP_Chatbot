# NLP_Chatbot

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a natural language processing chatbot using NLTK for text classification. The chatbot will be able to classify text into different categories such as "technical support," "billing," or "shipping."

## Phase 1: Text Processing and Spelling Correction
Phase 1 focuses on implementing fundamental NLP techniques for text processing and spelling correction using Python's Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and scikit-learn.

### Features Implemented
#### Text Processing
- Text cleaning (lowercase conversion, special character removal)
- Tokenization (word and sentence level)
- Stopword removal, Stemming 
- Pipeline creation for standardized text preprocessing
- Spelling Correction 
#### Training Data Preparation
- Sentence extraction from NLTK book corpus
- Processing of multiple text sources
- Creation of training dataset with source tracking
